The Office Supply Analysis for Dataleum.

The project goal was to determine which products were key drivers of performance and also identify which products performed made the most profit and those that suffered great losses to assist in decision making.

From the office supply dataset, calculated columns were created on Microsoft Power Bi such as the Gross sales, Discount using the discount rate, Revenue, Profit before and after tax, Profit margin, Tax on profit using a tax rate of 5%.

Power BI is an interactive data-visualization software product with a primary aim on data visualization.

After importing the data and adding the newly calculated columns into Power Bi, A new table for the calendar year was created and the data was modelled to show relationships between the original data and calendar tables. 

New measures for the totals of each financial column was also created, Card visual was used to show the values of the computed measures.

Textbox was inserted to add titles for each report page, buttons to add reset icons, as well as the company image icon.

Key findings are; 
 - The total profit by product indicated products' biro and pencil made profits when compared to the total manufacturing cost, 
 - Products markers, notepad and stapler did not yield any profits. 
 - Other key findings are as attached.

One of the recommendations given was that
